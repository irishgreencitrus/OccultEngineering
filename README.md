# Create: Occult Engineering

An integration between Occultism and the Create Mod.

## Currently Supported:
### Bulk Enspirit
Place a Spiritfire or a Spirit Campfire in front of an encased fan, to cause a purple effect.
This can be used to automate all the Spiritfire's recipes!
### Mechanical Arm Compatibility
Create's Mechanical Arm can now interact with:
- Stable Wormhole
- Dimensional Storage Actuator
- Sacrificial Bowl
### Spirit Solution
Get Spirit Solution by either mixing Demon's Dream Fruit with water with heat, or by crushing Demon's Dream Seeds.

Spirit Solution can be poured onto the unbound Books of Binding via the Spout in order to bind them!

### Mechanical Chamber

Use the Mechanical Chamber to more easily automate crafting rituals!

Powered from the top by Shaft, it works in place of a Golden Sacrificial Bowl in the center of a ritual.
The faster the shaft in the top spins, the faster the ritual will be completed i.e.
a shaft with speed 64 will complete the ritual twice as fast as a shaft with speed 32.

Place your Sacrificial Bowls as usual, within 8 blocks of the center to start it.

It works best with the Mechanical Arm:

- The Mechanical Arm will only insert a bound book into the chamber.
- The Mechanical Arm will only insert the book if the book completes the ritual.
- The Mechanical Arm will only extract results from the ritual, not the book itself.
